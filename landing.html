            <div class="w-1/2 border border-none h-full text-center flex items-center text-black-500">Despite the pervasive
                environmental impact of plastic pollution, there exists a significant lack of awareness among the
                general populace regarding the detrimental effects of improper plastic disposal. As a result, plastic
                waste is indiscriminately discarded, leading to environmental degradation and posing severe threats to
                ecosystems and public health. In response to this pressing issue, we aim to implement a solution that
                incentivizes plastic recycling by establishing a system for collecting plastic waste directly from
                individuals. By offering fair compensation for collected plastic, we seek to encourage community
                participation and promote responsible waste management practices. However, to effectively address this
                challenge, it is imperative to develop an efficient collection infrastructure, raise awareness about the
                importance of plastic recycling, and establish sustainable mechanisms for processing and repurposing
                collected plasticÂ materials</div>
